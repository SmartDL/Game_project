Prototype Instructions
The player first enters the map on the right to open the door on the map on the left, gets a hammer on the left that can break some walls, 
and returns to the right to get more props to improve their Atk and HP, and finally defeat the boss. If the player dies halfway through the game, 
the game will restart from the beginning. There are many enemies hidden in the mazes on both sides, players need to proceed carefully.
